==2. 文件组织 ==
A file consists of various sections that should be separated by several blank lines. Although there is no maximum length limit for source files, files with more than about 1000 lines are cumbersome to deal with. The editor may not have enough temp space to edit the file, compilations will go more slowly, etc. Many rows of asterisks, for example, present little information compared to the time it takes to scroll past, and are discouraged. Lines longer than 79 columns are not handled well by all terminals and should be avoided if possible. Excessively long lines which result from deep indenting are often a symptom of poorly-organized code.

===2.1 文件命名惯例===

File names are made up of a base name, and an optional period and suffix. The first character of the name should be a letter and all characters (except the period) should be lower-case letters and numbers. The base name should be eight or fewer characters and the suffix should be three or fewer characters (four, if you include the period). These rules apply to both program files and default files used and produced by the program (e.g., ``rogue.sav'').
